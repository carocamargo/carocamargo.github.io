The mass loss from Antarctica, Greenland and glaciers, and variations in land water storage cause sea-level changes. Here, we characterise the regional trends within these sea level contributions, taking into account mass variations since 1993. We take a comprehensive approach to determining the uncertainties of these sea-level changes, considering different types of errors. Our study reveals the importance of clearly quantifying the uncertainties of sea-level change trends.
