## Rising Tides

Climate change is affecting the world in different ways, from droughts to floods, from heat waves to sea-level rise. Death Valley is the driest place in North America, receiving about 2 inches of rain per year. In 2023, Hurricane Hillary and an atmospheric river changed the situation, bringing almost 5 inches of rain in just 6 months. Kona Lows have been halting the Big Island’s renowned sunshine, drenching the tropical island with frequent bouts of prolonged heavy rains. While these are natural phenomena, they are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. 

Another clear consequence of climate change is sea-level rise. In most coasts around the world, the sea-level is rising, and quickly. And while the rise and ebb of tides is a natural effect, the sea-level rise is bringing these variations closer to human settlements and infrastructures. Consequently, cities along the U.S. East coast experience flooding even without storms, simply due to above-normal water levels. Understanding how and why sea-level is changing in each region is fundamental to ensure the resilience of our coastal communities. 

Marcy’s images poignantly demonstrate the powerful impact of rising seas and climate change on our environment and the human experience.
