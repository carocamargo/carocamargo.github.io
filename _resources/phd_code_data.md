##  Codes:
Repositories containing scripts for PhD publications:
* Camargo et al., 2020: [Steric SL Git repository](https://github.com/carocamargo/stericSL)
* Camargo et al., 2022: [Mass SL Git repository](https://github.com/carocamargo/barystaticSLC)
* Camargo et al., 2023: [Regional SLB Git repository](https://github.com/carocamargo/regionalSLB)

Self-organising Maps: 
* Tutorial with matlab toolbox: [Public Git repository for NIOZ-SL group](https://github.com/NIOZ-SL/SOM_example) - This repository is private because it contains toolboxes not developed by me. For examples of how to use it, please contact me. 
* Examples with Python packages, but not very well developed: [SOM python Git repository](https://github.com/carocamargo/Python-Packages-Tutorials/tree/main/SOM) 

Sea-level Equation:
* [Private Git repository for NIOZ-SL group](https://github.com/NIOZ-SL/SL_Equation/tree/main) - This repository is private because it contains model code not developed by me.  For examples of how to use it, please contact me. 

Trends with Hector:
* [Hector Git repository](https://github.com/NIOZ-SL/python_for_SL/tree/main/examples/hector/)

Steric computation example:
* [Steric SL Git repository](https://github.com/carocamargo/Python-Packages-Tutorials/tree/main/gsw)

delta-Maps:

## Data:
All data supporting the dissertation is available at the 4TU.Research Data [repository](https://doi.org/10.4121/22117046). Additionally, for each of the published chap-
ters the underlying data and code are available at individual repositories, as described
below:
* Chapter 2: The steric fields and trends produced in this research, as well as supporting scripts, are
available at the 4TU.Research Data [repository](https://doi.org/10.4121/12764933).
* Chapter 3: The regional mass-driven sea-level fields and uncertainties the figures of this chapter
are available from the 4TU.ResearchData [repository](https://doi.org/10.4121/16778794).
* Chapter 4: All the contributions to the regional sea-level budget as well as the sub-basins polygons are available from [Zenodo repository](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7007330).
